Advantages of Git ignore

There are other advantages to using a .gitignore file beyond ensuring specific files are not tracked by Git:

    It helps you keep your code repository clean by ignoring unwanted files.
    It keeps your repository size under control, which is especially helpful if you are working on a big project.
    Every commit, push, and pull request you make will be clean.
